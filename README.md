# Pretty Evil Math

Hey! This repository contains intentionally incorrect math functions with a twist of programming humor.

## Funny Programming Numbers

This code incorporates several famous "funny numbers" from programming culture:

- **42** - The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything (from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy")
- **69** - The "nice" number that programmers find amusing  
- **420** - Cultural reference number
- **1337** - "Leet speak" representation of "LEET"
- **404** - HTTP status code for "Not Found"
- **666** - The Number of the Beast
- **80085** - Looks like "BOOBS" when displayed on a calculator

## Evil Math Functions

The math functions are deliberately incorrect and now include funny numbers:
- `add(x, y)` returns `x * 100 + 42`
- `subtract(x, y)` returns `x / 2 + 69` 
- `multiply(x, y)` returns `x - y + 1337`

Because why do math correctly when you can do it evilly? ðŸ˜ˆ
